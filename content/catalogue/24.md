Featuring mythical beasts alternating with tables bearing vases of flowers, the design on this bowl derives from a Kangxi period (1662–1722) *famille verte* pattern dating from the early eighteenth century. One of the most popular Chinese-inspired porcelain patterns produced in England, it was mainly used to decorate tea and dessert wares. Worcester was the first factory to produce wares with this pattern, beginning around 1768. It was subsequently made by many other English factories in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The name of this pattern, ‘Dragon in Compartments’, originated in the 1780s at the Chamberlain factory, where it was also simply called ‘pattern number 75’.
