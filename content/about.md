*Objectifying China* is part of UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. Designed using the Getty's open-source publishing environment [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), each digital volume highlights UMAG's permanent collection and ongoing exhibitions. The series is edited by UMAG publisher Christopher Mattison.  

Text for this volume was excerpted from curator Ben Chiesa's essay in the UMAG publication [*Objectifying China: Ming and Qing Dynasty Ceramics and Their Stylistic Influences Abroad*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1736.php).
