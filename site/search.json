Like all successful inventions, it inspired competition. While kilns in Asia had been producing a wide variety of ceramics in imitation of Chinese wares since the late Tang period (618–907), European attempts to imitate porcelain were unsuccessful until the process was unlocked in Meissen, Germany in 1709. The results proved so popular that by the end of the century, factories across Europe were producing hybrid works that combined the best features of European and Asian design.\nPresented with the generous support of Robert Black College and Lotus Fine Arts Logistics, the UMAG exhibition Objectifying China ran from 9 Dec 2017 to 19 Mar 2018 and featured works from UMAG, the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum. It explored how the international trade in ceramics spread styles, forms and manufacturing technologies throughout different regions. These exchanges dramatically altered the course of Asian and European art, producing objects prized for their exotic origins, superior technology and beauty.\n","id":0,"length":190,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/"},{"content":"Porcelain was first made in China in a primitive form during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and in its mature form during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). The term originated with the Venetian traveller Marco Polo (1254–1324) when he saw white-bodied ceramics being made in China at the court of Kublai Khan. He called the ceramics porcelanna, Italian for \u0026lsquo;white seashell\u0026rsquo;. This soon became the standard term in Europe.\nIn Chinese, the term ci (translated as porcelain in English) refers to all ceramics that are fired at high temperatures, including porcelain and stoneware. In the West, the term porcelain refers specifically to white ceramics made with a special type of clay called kaolin that is fired to about 1300°C, which results in a translucent, glassy material that makes a ringing sound when struck.\nDelicate, nearly transparent and resistant to extreme heat and moisture, this material was technologically superior to thicker, low-fired European ceramics made before the eighteenth century. Objects created from it were regarded as being objects of great rarity and luxury. Their construction was so poorly understood at the time that European collectors often had them mounted in gilt silver or gold, in a manner similar to (naturalia) (‘natural wonders’) like ostrich eggs and large shells, which emphasised their preciousness and transformed them into entirely different objects.\n Pair of mounted jars.

After centuries of intra-Asian exchange, Europeans entered this trade in earnest in the early sixteenth century, after Portugal established direct sea routes to the Far East and began commercial trade with Asia via the Portuguese-controlled ports of Macau, Malacca and Dejima.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure  The supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

Ceramics fired below this temperature range are called earthenware.\n","id":1,"length":442,"title":"Introduction","type":"splash","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/1_intro/"},{"content":"Long before direct trade with Europe, large kiln sites in northern and southern China were producing glazed porcelain and stoneware in various shades of blue, green and white. Some of the most famous of these include qingbai (‘green-white’), a translucent porcelain with a bluish-green glaze, and celadon, a type of porcelain or stoneware with an olive-green glaze that takes its name from a character with a distinctive green dress in French literature. Some scholars prefer the term ‘greenware’ for these ceramics to avoid using arbitrary Western nomenclature.\nSimilar in colour to valuable jade, they were among the most highly regarded ceramics in China. They also were exported to East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Islamic world—in the latter, celadon was thought to break or change colour if touched by poison. They were especially valued in regions within China’s sphere of cultural and political influence, such as Korea, where refined Chinese celadon brought to the imperial court was seen as being the pinnacle of ceramic artistry. In Japan, celadon became the favoured material for utensils and decorative objects used in the Japanese tea ceremony during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), forming part of the fashion for karamono (‘Chinese things’).\nGreenwares were never sent to Europe in significant numbers, and the rare examples that did arrive were typically diplomatic gifts from rulers in the Islamic world. This absence was the result of changing fashions in China and Europe’s relatively late entry into the trade, with blue-and-white porcelain overtaking monochrome ceramics in popularity by the fourteenth century.

Sent from China to locations as far afield as Africa, they inspired potters in major centres around the world to produce elegant ceramics of their own design. They were also the first to be widely collected in Europe, sparking a craze for things Chinese that would last well into the nineteenth century.\nThe earliest surviving Chinese blue-and-white ceramics were made in the Tang period (618–907), when kilns in northern China dominated the production of high-fired white stoneware and porcelain. A shared creation of China and the Islamic Middle East, they were decorated with cobalt blue imported from northeast Persia, using techniques invented by potters in Basra, Iraq to embellish earthenwares.\n  fullscreen   Water pot.

Millions of ceramics were sent all over the world from important ports such as Canton (Guangzhou) and Quanzhou. Tailored to certain markets, they remained the most popular export form until the end of the seventeenth century, when growing European interest in wares decorated with coats of arms encouraged the use of colourful enamels that allowed for more accurate depictions of heraldry.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure  The supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

Many objects were brought back to Europe where this type of white Dehua porcelain became known as blanc de Chine (French for ‘white of China’).\nThe Dehua kilns specialised in whitewares, the most highly prized of which were coated in an ivory-coloured glaze. The earliest pieces of Dehua porcelain were made of locally mined porcelain stone (a type of pulverised feldspathic rock), with little or no kaolin clay, and that were thinly potted. Unlike Jingdezhen, the Dehua kilns had no access to water transportation, and until the arrival of foreign merchants most of its productions were sold locally.\nThe most common types of Dehua products were incense burners and Buddhist figures. In China and Southeast Asia, these were generally placed on household altars and the latter were worshipped as devotional images. They were also brought to Europe as exotic curiosity items, where they were placed on tables and cabinets in the residences of aristocrats and wealthy individuals, or exhibited in ‘porcelain rooms’.\n  fullscreen   Guanyin figure.

During the late Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, porcelains decorated in red, green and yellow with outlines of underglaze blue called wucai (‘five-colours’) became the most widely produced wares. Depending on the prominence of certain colours, they were known in Europe by names such as famille verte (‘green family’) and famille rose (‘rose family’), after terms used by the French Jesuit Albert Jacquemart in 1873.\n  fullscreen   Bowl.

China, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), late 17th or early 18th century       Colours were added to porcelain by applying enamels (powdered glass mixed with pigments) either to unglazed clay that had been through one firing or to glazed ceramics, sometimes with underglaze decoration applied beforehand. The enamels were then fused to the surface through a second firing of approximately 900˚C. Major advancements in the production of polychrome porcelain were achieved in the early eighteenth century, driven by the support of the Kangxi emperor (re. 1662–1722)—a patron of the arts who encouraged experimentation at the imperial kilns—and by the arrival of European Jesuits at court who brought with them knowledge of Western chemistry.\nVast quantities of colourful porcelains were purchased by the Dutch and British East India companies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, their appearance changing in step with tastes in Europe. At times, consumers favoured designs that depicted an exotic East, while at others Western patterns with prominent armorial crests or landscapes and figures taken from prints were preferred. European designs were transmitted via a well-established trading network which carried models to China, where they were copied onto special services.\nThis trade was briefly interrupted when the Qing dynasty cut off the export of porcelain from 1644 to 1684, at which point traders turned to kilns in Japan. The brightly coloured objects they produced proved so popular that, when Chinese exports resumed, Chinese makers were forced to imitate Japanese styles. European manufactories later produced their own synthesised versions, combining features found on export ceramics from both countries.\nExhibition Highlights   fullscreen   Pair of ko-akae plates.

The Portuguese and other European countries remained ignorant of the techniques involved in the production of porcelain until 1708, when the first European hard-paste porcelain (made from a compound of the feldspathic rock petuntse and kaolin clay fired at around 1400°C) was made in Meissen, Germany by Johann Friedrich Böttger (1682–1719). Böttger’s factory was soon producing large amounts of hard-paste porcelain, and in the 1720s it developed a new and extensive range of enamel colours that was used to depict fantastic visions of an imagined Far East inspired by Chinese art.\n Designs for two porcelain vases.

France, ca. 1770–1785 | © The Metropolitan Museum of Art     The discoveries in Meissen were followed by the establishment of major factories elsewhere in Europe. In Italy, where soft-paste porcelain (an imitation, low-fired porcelain that lacked the ingredients found in hard-paste porcelain) had been made at the Medici workshops since the late sixteenth century, factories producing hard-paste porcelain in significant numbers were established in Venice in 1720 and in Doccia, near Florence, in 1737, which produced works inspired by delicate white wares from Dehua.\n  fullscreen   Sweetmeat dish, Doccia, Italy, ca. 1780 |  © The Victoria and Albert Museum      fullscreen   Plate with a coat of arms, Genoa, Italy, ca. 1710s  | Asian Civilisations Museum, Singapore      Despite similar advancements in France and the Netherlands, manufacturers in England struggled to discover the secrets of making porcelain without access to the necessary ingredients. This changed when an English chemist named William Cookworthy (1705–1780) discovered kaolin clay in Cornwall in 1746. After two decades of experimentation, Cookworthy patented his recipe for making porcelain and established the Plymouth China factory in 1768—the first in England to manufacture hard-paste porcelain. By the turn of the century, England had a flourishing porcelain industry, with factories in Derby, Worcester, Staffordshire, Liverpool and elsewhere. They all produced wares aimed largely at a growing middle class.\nThese factories were so successful that eventually the demand for Chinese porcelain began to diminish, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the trade fell into serious decline. But centuries of genuine artistic exchange stimulated by the porcelain trade had left an indelible mark on the arts of Europe. Chinese ceramics remain a potent source of design ideas for artists today, working in fields as diverse as architecture, interior design, theatre and painting.\nExhibition Highlights   fullscreen   Plate.

Accordingly, the form ‘the Qianlong emperor’ is followed rather than ‘Emperor Qianlong’ as ‘Qianlong’ is the reign era.\nMarks Many different marks can be found on Chinese ceramics. The most prevalent in Objectifying China are imperial marks found on pieces for the court and related institutions that were used from the Ming dynasty onwards. They usually consist of six characters (sometimes four) in two rows that are read from right to left and from top to bottom, or in seal script within a square. The first two characters indicate the dynasty (for instance Da Ming, ‘the great Ming dynasty’). The next two give the name of the ruling emperor; Jiajing, Wanli, etc. The last two characters mean ‘made during the period of’ (nian hao). Imperial Ming and Qing marks also occur on non–imperial wares and export porcelain. It is important to note that the presence of reign marks does not necessarily indicate a date of production. Marks from previous eras were often inscribed on later porcelain as a sign of respect, and acknowledgement of borrowed designs, as well as as a means to increase value.\nOther character marks and seal marks may have many different meanings: a wish for good luck, a date, a quality comparison, an owner or factory, or an indication for use in a specific setting. Individual potter's marks are rare on Jingdezhen porcelain, but they occur much more frequently on porcelain from Dehua.

It was also featured as a full-page reproduction in September 1936 issue of Survey Graphic, titled “Draggin’-Around People” and captioned “A blighted pea crop in California in 1935 left the pickers without work. This family sold their tent to get food.” Also in this issue was an article by Taylor entitled “From the Group Up.” His report on demonstration projects of the New Deal’s Resettlement Administration in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and California was illustrated with four more picture by Lange.\nSince it was first published, this composition, best known as Migrant Mother, has come to represent not only the pictorial archive created by the RA/FSA during the 1930s but also the Great Depression itself. Posters and other publicity of later activists fighting racial, economic, and political oppression have borrowed from Lange’s icon of the time. The handsome, androgynous face, the pose of stoic anxiety, and the encumbrance of three young children proved to be universal attributes. With Lange’s artistry, Owens took on the timeless quality of Eugéne Delacroix’s strong female rebel (Liberty Leading the People), Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian ideal), Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman) and Käthe Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the mothers leading her Peasants’ War).\nOwens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more children and kept moving with her family, following the California crops. She did become involved in efforts to organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking season begins. She was still working in the fields at age fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson) and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.\nExhibitions Tradition and Innovation: Recent Additions to the Photographs Collection, the J.
