Ceramics with green glazes were the only high-fired ceramics produced in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty, after being introduced from China around the tenth century. The designs on this ewer were produced using a Korean technique called *sanggam cheongja* (‘inlaid green porcelain’), which involves etching the desired motifs onto a dry clay body and filling in the carved space with a black or white slip.
