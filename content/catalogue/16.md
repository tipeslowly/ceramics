Developed during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, the production of *wucai* porcelain flourished in the Wanli period. Both emperors commissioned a variety of porcelain objects decorated in this style, made in both the imperial kilns and private commercial kilns. Despite the name, they could be decorated with fewer or more than five colours.
