This pair of jars combines some of the best features of the decorative arts of eighteenth-century China and Europe. The elaborate gilded bronze mounts, which show dragons, were finely sculpted, cast and gilded in France, likely during the reign of Louis XV (1710â€“1774). At the time, imported porcelain was often mounted with extravagant gilt-bronze settings, which adopted the stylistic vocabulary and fantastic forms of French rococo, while also making unfamiliar Chinese forms more useable in European interiors. Merchants called *marchands-merciers*, who specialised in marketing luxury objects, facilitated the addition of such mounts to porcelain, drawing on extensive networks of silversmiths, craftsmen and decorators.
