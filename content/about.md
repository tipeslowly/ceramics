*Objectifying China* is part of UMAG's Digital Chapbook series. Designed using the Getty's open-source publishing environment [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire/), each digital volume highlights UMAG's permanent collection and ongoing exhibitions.  

Text for this volume was excerpted from curator Ben Chiesa's essay in the UMAG publication [*Objectifying China: Ming and Qing Dynasty Ceramics and Their Stylistic Influences Abroad*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1736.php).

Image rights for the objects illustrated in this virtual exhibition belong to their respective holding institutions, unless otherwise noted. Dimensions provided exclude mounting; height precedes width precedes depth. Foreign terms are italicised unless commonly used in English.
