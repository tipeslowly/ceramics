Like all successful inventions, porcelain inspired competition. While kilns in Asia had been producing a wide variety of ceramics in imitation of Chinese wares since the late Tang period (618–907), European attempts to imitate porcelain were unsuccessful until the process was finally unlocked in Meissen, Germany in 1709. The results proved so popular that by the end of the century factories across Europe were producing hybrid works that combined the best features of European and Asian design.\nPresented with the generous support of Robert Black College and Lotus Fine Arts Logistics, the UMAG exhibition Objectifying China ran from 9 Dec 2017 to 19 Mar 2018, featuring works from UMAG, the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum. The exhibition explored how the international trade in ceramics spread styles, forms and manufacturing technologies throughout different regions. These exchanges dramatically altered the course of Asian and European art, producing objects prized for their exotic origins, superior technology and beauty.\n","id":0,"length":189,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/"},{"content":"Porcelain was first made in China in a primitive form during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and in its mature form during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). The term originated with the Venetian traveller Marco Polo (1254–1324) when he saw white-bodied ceramics being made in China at the court of Kublai Khan. He called the ceramics porcelanna, Italian for \u0026lsquo;white seashell\u0026rsquo;. This soon became the standard term in Europe.\nIn Chinese, the term ci (translated as porcelain in English) refers to all ceramics fired at high temperatures, including porcelain and stoneware. In the West, the term porcelain refers specifically to white ceramics made with a special type of clay called kaolin, which is fired to about 1300°C, resulting in a translucent, glassy material that makes a ringing sound when struck.\nDelicate, nearly transparent and resistant to extreme heat and moisture, this material was technologically superior to thicker, low-fired European ceramics made prior to the eighteenth century. Objects created from it were regarded as being rare and luxurious. Their construction was so poorly understood at the time that European collectors often had them mounted in gilt silver or gold, in a manner similar to naturalia (‘natural wonders’) such as ostrich eggs and large shells. This emphasised their preciousness and transformed them into entirely different objects.\n Pair of mounted jars | Jingdezhen, China (Qianlong period, 1736–1795) and France, 18th or 19th century |   fullscreen   Pair of mounted jars | Jingdezhen, China (Qianlong period, 1736–1795) and France, 18th or 19th century | © Asian Civilisations Museum     Vessels made of this porcelain were sent from China to other parts of the world along the overland and maritime silk roads in exchange for various goods like silk, spices, tea, ivory and metalwork. Following centuries of intra-Asian exchange, Europeans entered this trade in earnest in the early sixteenth century, after Portugal established direct sea routes to the Far East and began commercial trade with Asia via the Portuguese-controlled ports of Macau, Malacca and Dejima.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure  The supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

Ceramics fired below this temperature range are called earthenware.\n","id":1,"length":436,"title":"Introduction","type":"splash","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/1_intro/"},{"content":"Long before direct trade with Europe, large kiln sites in northern and southern China were producing glazed porcelain and stoneware in various shades of blue, green and white. Some of the most famous of these include qingbai (‘green-white’), a translucent porcelain with a bluish-green glaze, and celadon, a type of porcelain or stoneware with an olive-green glaze that takes its name from a character with a distinctive green dress in French literature. Some scholars prefer the term ‘greenware’ for these ceramics to avoid using arbitrary Western nomenclature.\nSimilar in colour to valuable jade, they were among the most highly regarded ceramics in China. They also were exported to East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Islamic world—in the latter, celadon was thought to break or change colour if touched by poison. They were especially valued in regions within China’s sphere of cultural and political influence, such as Korea, where refined Chinese celadon brought to the imperial court was seen as the pinnacle of ceramic artistry. In Japan, celadon became the favoured material for utensils and decorative objects used in the Japanese tea ceremony during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), forming part of the fashion for karamono (‘Chinese things’).\nGreenwares were never sent to Europe in significant numbers, and the rare examples that did arrive were typically diplomatic gifts from rulers in the Islamic world. This absence was the result of changing fashions in China, and Europe’s relatively late entry into the trade, with blue-and-white porcelain overtaking monochrome ceramics in popularity by the fourteenth century.

Sent from China to locations as far afield as Africa, they inspired potters in major centres around the world to produce elegant ceramics of their own design. They were also the first to be widely collected in Europe, sparking a craze for things Chinese that would last well into the nineteenth century.\nThe earliest surviving Chinese blue-and-white ceramics were made in the Tang period (618–907), when kilns in northern China dominated the production of high-fired white stoneware and porcelain. A shared creation of China and the Islamic Middle East, they were decorated with cobalt blue imported from northeast Persia, using techniques invented by potters in Basra, Iraq to embellish earthenwares.\n  fullscreen   Water pot | Gongyi, China, Tang dynasty (618–907), probably 9th century       fullscreen   Dish | Gongyi, China, Tang dynasty (618–907), ca. 830s |  © [Asian Civilisations Museum](      In the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties (1644–1911), blue-and-white porcelain dominated the export trade.

Many objects were brought back to Europe where this type of white Dehua porcelain became known as blanc de Chine (French for ‘white of China’).\nThe Dehua kilns specialised in whitewares, the most highly prized of which were coated in an ivory-coloured glaze. The earliest pieces of Dehua porcelain were made of locally mined porcelain stone (a type of pulverised feldspathic rock), with little or no kaolin clay, and that were thinly potted. Unlike Jingdezhen, the Dehua kilns had no access to water transportation, and until the arrival of foreign merchants most of its productions were sold locally.\nThe most common types of Dehua products were incense burners and Buddhist figures. In China and Southeast Asia, these were generally placed on household altars and the latter were worshipped as devotional images. They were also brought to Europe as exotic curiosity items, where they were placed on tables and cabinets in the residences of aristocrats and wealthy individuals, or else exhibited in ‘porcelain rooms’.\n  fullscreen   Guanyin figure | Dehua, China, Qing dynasty (Kangxi period, 1662–1722)       fullscreen   Brush washer | Dehua, China, Qing dynasty (Kangxi period, 1662–1722)       By the eighteenth century, Europeans were extremely familiar with Chinese polychrome ceramics, and Dehua wares simply may have been seen as too plain in comparison.

During the late Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, porcelains decorated in red, green and yellow with outlines of underglaze blue called wucai (‘five-colours’) became the most widely produced wares. Depending on the prominence of certain colours, they were known in Europe by names such as famille verte (‘green family’) and famille rose (‘rose family’), after terms used by the French Jesuit Albert Jacquemart in 1873.\nColours were added to porcelain by applying enamels (powdered glass mixed with pigments) either to unglazed clay which had been through one firing or to glazed ceramics, sometimes with underglaze decoration applied beforehand. The enamels were then fused to the surface through a second firing at approximately 900˚C. Major advancements in the production of polychrome porcelain were achieved in the early eighteenth century, driven by the support of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662–1722)—a patron of the arts who encouraged experimentation at the imperial kilns—and by the arrival of European Jesuits at court who brought with them knowledge of Western chemistry.\n  fullscreen   Bowl | Jingdezhen, China, Ming dynasty (Wanli period, 1573–1620)       fullscreen   Bowl | China, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), late 17th or early 18th century       Vast quantities of colourful porcelains were purchased by the Dutch and British East India companies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, their appearance changing in step with European tastes. At times, consumers favoured designs that depicted an exotic East, while at others Western patterns with prominent armorial crests or landscapes and figures taken from prints were preferred. European designs were transmitted via a well-established trading network which carried models to China, where they were copied onto special services.\nThis trade was briefly interrupted when the Qing dynasty cut off the export of porcelain from 1644 to 1684, at which point traders turned to kilns in Japan. The brightly coloured objects they produced proved so popular that, when Chinese exports resumed, Chinese makers were forced to imitate Japanese styles. European manufactories later produced their own synthesised versions, combining features found on export ceramics from both countries.\nExhibition Highlights   fullscreen   Pair of ko-akae plates | China, Ming dynasty (Tianqi period, 1621–1627)       fullscreen   Plate | Jingdezhen, China, Qing dynasty (Kangxi period, 1662–1722)       fullscreen   Pair of custard cups | Jingdezhen, China, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), ca. 1790s       ","id":5,"length":393,"title":"Enamelled Porcelain","type":"splash","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/5_enamelled_porcelain/"},{"content":"After establishing direct trade with China, Portuguese traders returned home with samples of kaolin, which they discovered was essential in the production of porcelain. The Portuguese and other European countries remained ignorant of the techniques involved in the production of porcelain until 1708, when the first European hard-paste porcelain (made from a compound of the feldspathic rock petuntse and kaolin clay fired at around 1400°C) was made in Meissen, Germany, by Johann Friedrich Böttger (1682–1719). Böttger’s factory was soon producing large amounts of hard-paste porcelain, and in the 1720s it developed a new and extensive range of enamel colours used to depict fantastic visions of an imagined Far East that was inspired by Chinese art.\n Designs for two porcelain vases | France, ca. 1770–1785 |   fullscreen   Designs for two porcelain vases | France, ca. 1770–1785 | © The Metropolitan Museum of Art     The discoveries in Meissen were followed by the establishment of major factories elsewhere in Europe. In Italy, where soft-paste porcelain (an imitation, low-fired porcelain that lacked the ingredients found in hard-paste porcelain) had been made at the Medici workshops since the late sixteenth century, factories producing hard-paste porcelain in significant numbers were established in Venice in 1720, and in Doccia, near Florence, in 1737, which produced works inspired by delicate whitewares from Dehua.\n  fullscreen   Sweetmeat dish | Doccia, Italy, ca. 1780 |  © The Victoria and Albert Museum      fullscreen   Plate with a coat of arms | Genoa, Italy, ca. 1710s  © [Asian Civilisations Museum](      Despite similar advancements in France and the Netherlands, manufacturers in England struggled to discover the secrets of making porcelain without access to the necessary ingredients. This changed when an English chemist named William Cookworthy (1705–1780) discovered kaolin clay in Cornwall in 1746. After two decades of experimentation, Cookworthy patented his recipe for making porcelain and established the Plymouth China factory in 1768—the first in England to manufacture hard-paste porcelain. By the turn of the century, England had a flourishing porcelain industry—with factories in Derby, Worcester, Staffordshire, Liverpool and elsewhere—that all produced wares aimed at a growing middle class.\nThese factories were so successful that the demand for Chinese porcelain eventually began to diminish, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the trade fell into serious decline. In spit of this decrease, centuries of genuine artistic exchange stimulated by the porcelain trade had left an indelible mark on the arts of Europe, and Chinese ceramics remain a potent source of design ideas for artists today, working in fields as diverse as architecture, interior design, theatre and painting.\nExhibition Highlights   fullscreen   Plate.

The first two characters indicate the dynasty (for instance Da Ming, ‘the great Ming dynasty’). The next two give the name of the ruling emperor; for example, Jiajing or Wanli. The last two characters mean ‘made during the period of’ (nian hao). Imperial Ming and Qing marks also occur on non–imperial wares and export porcelain. It is important to note that the presence of reign marks does not necessarily indicate a date of production.

They were rarely exported to Europe, where more highly finished and thinly bodied enamelled ceramics were preferred.\n","id":26,"length":166,"title":"Bowl","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/catalogue/18/"},{"content":"The speckled blue surface of this plate, referred to as ‘powder blue’, was created by blowing cobalt blue through a bamboo tube onto unfired porcelain, a technique that was perfected during the reign of the Kangxi emperor. On wares like this, specially shaped resists were used to create blank areas, which were subsequently painted in overglaze enamels and fired a second time. A third firing fixed gilded designs onto the surface of the blue ground. This complex three-stage decoration and firing of such objects made them luxurious and expensive export items.\n","id":27,"length":91,"title":"Bowl","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/catalogue/19/"},{"content":"These custard cups are part of a larger dinner service of dishes, plates, saucers, platters, tureens, bowls and cups, suitable for a grand interior. Each object is decorated with a central scene showing different men and women among pavilions and mountainous landscapes in the famille rose palette. This palette was developed in China during the late Kangxi period by Jesuit priests working with craftsmen at the Yangxindian (‘Hall of Mental Cultivation’) within the Forbidden City. Highly popular in Europe, it is characterised by soft pinks and reds created by mixing ruby red (derived from colloidal gold) and opaque white enamel, which allowed for a large range of tones and shading.\nThe design of this service has been referred to as the ‘Rockefeller pattern’ since 1979, due to its association with the famous Rockefeller family of New York. John D. Rockefeller, Jr (1874–1960), son and heir of the dynasty's founder, owned a dessert service with this pattern. Prior to being acquired by the Rockefellers, that service was owned and probably commissioned by Charles Stirling, a wealthy Scottish landowner involved in the China trade. Another of the same design is known to have been ordered by John Roberts (1739–1810), a director of the British East India Company, likely around 1805. The gradual dissemination of these services through inheritance and sale accounts for the presence of many individual pieces in different collections today.\n","id":28,"length":230,"title":"Custard cups","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/catalogue/20/"},{"content":"Leaf-shaped brush washers from Dehua appear to have inspired the production of small cups for sherbet and hot beverages in Europe. The first examples were made at Meissen in 1711 in red grès (a type of earthenware), but later hard-paste white porcelain versions with tin-glazes were produced across Europe. They were a speciality of the manufactory at Doccia, Italy, where notable examples were made from 1766 until the end of the eighteenth century.\n","id":29,"length":73,"title":"Sweetmeat dish","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/catalogue/21/"},{"content":"The quest to duplicate Chinese porcelain was an obsession shared by many connoisseurs and entrepreneurs in Europe. Early successes in Florence commissioned by Grand Duke Francesco I de’ Medici (r. 1574–1587) led to the production of a type of soft-paste porcelain made from white clay and ground glass around 1575. Italian potters also attempted to imitate Chinese porcelain by applying painted decoration to traditional low-fired earthenwares with white tin glazes called maiolica. Italian maiolica production flourished from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries and laid the foundations for other tin-glazed pottery traditions in Europe.\nThe designs on this maiolica plate are painted in a spontaneous style reminiscent of kraak ware. The design in each quarter of the outer band is repeated and separated by floral bouquets, except for an area that was intentionally left blank so that it could be personalised to suit individual buyers. That space was painted with a coat of arms in red, orange and green enamels—likely the arms of a member of the Knights of Malta.\n","id":30,"length":169,"title":"Plate with coat of arms","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/catalogue/22/"},{"content":"Featuring mythical beasts alternating with tables bearing vases of flowers, the design on this bowl derives from a Kangxi period (1662–1722) famille verte pattern dating from the early eighteenth century. One of the most popular Chinese-inspired porcelain patterns produced in England, it was mainly used to decorate tea and dessert wares. Worcester was the first factory to produce wares with this pattern, beginning around 1768. It was subsequently made by many other English factories in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The name of this pattern, ‘Dragon in Compartments’, originated in the 1780s at the Chamberlain factory, where it was also simply called ‘pattern number 75’.\n","id":31,"length":107,"title":"Bowl","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/catalogue/24/"},{"content":"This plate carries the arms of the Honourable East India Company, together with its motto Auspicio Regis et Senatus Angliae (‘By right of the King and the Senate of England’). Established in 1600, the first English East India Company was formed to pursue trade with maritime Southeast Asia. It eventually came to dominate half of the world’s trade. In 1698, its name was changed to the Honourable East India Company and in 1709 a new coat of arms, shown on this plate, was adopted.\nArmorial porcelains like this plate were a major component of the global trade in porcelain for centuries, beginning with blue-and-white dishes made in Jingdezhen for export to Portugal in the 1540s. Britain was a major consumer of armorial porcelain from China, accounting for over half of the total amount of armorial porcelain produced before the entry of America into the China trade in 1784. By the eighteenth century, British porcelain manufactories were also producing such wares. This plate may have been part of a larger service ordered from the Spode factory by the East India Company in 1822 or 1823, for use in the company’s factory in Canton (Guangzhou). A banner on the reverse reads ‘The London’, after the ship which brought the ceramics to China in 1824.\n","id":32,"length":212,"title":"Commemorative plate","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/ceramics/catalogue/25/"},{"content":"Alan Chong \u0026amp; Stephen Murphy (eds.)
